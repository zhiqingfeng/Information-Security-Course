**1. Summarize of Moritz Abrell - Phreaking 2.0 - Abusing Microsoft Teams Direct Routing**

Moritz Abrell is the IT security consultant and penetration tester. 

This presentation is discusses the security risks of Microsoft Teams Direct Routing, a technology that allows the routing of calls from VoIP providers to the Teams platform. Abrell explains how the lack of authentication and authorization in the Direct Routing protocol can be exploited to access sensitive conversations and potentially eavesdrop on conversations. 

Microsoft Teams Direct Routing is a feature of Microsoft Teams that allows organizations to connect their phone system directly to Teams. This enables users to make and receive calls using their Teams app, making it easier and more cost-effective to make and manage phone calls. However, due to the way Direct Routing is implemented, it can be abused to make unauthorized calls or to hide the origin of the call. In this talk, I will discuss how attackers can abuse Direct Routing, what mitigations are available, and how to protect your organization from these kinds of attacks.

He also discusses how attackers can use the protocol to call out to premium services and generate large phone bills. 

Finally, Abrell provides solutions for mitigating the risks associated with Direct Routing and recommends that users take measures to secure their networks and monitor their traffic for malicious activity.

This presentation provides an overview of the security risks associated with Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and explains how attackers can exploit the protocol. He also provides solutions for mitigating the risks and suggests that users take steps to ensure their networks are secure.
