**1. Summarize of Moritz Abrell - Phreaking 2.0 - Abusing Microsoft Teams Direct Routing**

Moritz Abrell is the IT security consultant and penetration tester. 

This presentation is discusses the security risks of Microsoft Teams Direct Routing, a technology that allows the routing of calls from VoIP providers to the Teams platform. Abrell explains how the lack of authentication and authorization in the Direct Routing protocol can be exploited to access sensitive conversations and potentially eavesdrop on conversations. 

Microsoft Teams Direct Routing is a feature of Microsoft Teams that allows organizations to connect their phone system directly to Teams. This enables users to make and receive calls using their Teams app, making it easier and more cost-effective to make and manage phone calls. However, due to the way Direct Routing is implemented, it can be abused to make unauthorized calls or to hide the origin of the call. In this talk, I will discuss how attackers can abuse Direct Routing, what mitigations are available, and how to protect your organization from these kinds of attacks.

He also discusses how attackers can use the protocol to call out to premium services and generate large phone bills. 

Finally, Abrell provides solutions for mitigating the risks associated with Direct Routing and recommends that users take measures to secure their networks and monitor their traffic for malicious activity.

This presentation provides an overview of the security risks associated with Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and explains how attackers can exploit the protocol. He also provides solutions for mitigating the risks and suggests that users take steps to ensure their networks are secure.

**2. Slava Makkaveev - Digging into Xiaomiâ€™s TEE to get to Chinese money **

Slava Makkaveev is a security Researcher at Check Point Research.

*Backgroud of Xiaomi and TEE:*

Xiaomi is a Chinese electronics company that has become popular in recent years for its range of innovative products. One of the products that stands out is their Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This is an embedded system that works alongside the main processor and provides additional security for the device. It has been designed to protect important data from being accessed by malicious actors.

The TEE is based on the ARM TrustZone technology which is used by many other companies. It works by isolating sensitive data and processes from the main processor, keeping them secure and inaccessible. The TEE also provides an additional layer of security by encrypting data before it is sent or received.

The TEE is a key part of Xiaomi's strategy to increase its presence in the Chinese market. The company has been working to make its products more secure and appealing to Chinese consumers. This is especially important considering the amount of money and data that is exchanged in the country. By having a secure TEE, Xiaomi can ensure that their products are secure and can help protect their customers' data.

The TEE is a crucial part of Xiaomi's success in China. It helps to protect the company's customers from malicious actors and also helps them to build trust with their customers. This, in turn, helps to increase sales and the company's overall presence in the Chinese market.
